          The annual cost of attending college in the US includes living
          expenses, tuition fees, books and supplies, and health insurance.
          Simply stated, attending any US university will cost you money.
          However, depending on the university or college, there can be
          academic, artistic, athletic, or even service-based scholarships
          available, as well as need-based financial help such as grants for
          international students.

          Graduate programmes typically take less time than undergraduate
          programmes one to two years for master's degrees, for example, and
          they may even cost less overall. While most undergraduate students
          receive financial aid from their families to complete their bachelor's
          degrees, the majority of international students enrolled in higher
          education in the USA pay for their graduate degrees out of pocket or
          receive some form of financial benefit from the universities they
          intend to attend. The following table indicates the approximate annual
          cost of studying in USA for Indian students including their tuition
          fees as well as room and board costs for different levels of study and
          types of institutions:

          With an F-1 student visa, you are able to pay for your education at US
          universities or colleges with help of funding from friends, family, or
          your own finances. When your academic year is in progress, you are
          also allowed to work part-time for a maximum of 20 hours per week on
          campus.

          You can apply for an M-1 visa to study at institutions recognised by
          the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) if you intend to
          pursue vocational education in the USA. With an M-1 student visa, you
          can only work on campus for a maximum of six months and are subject to
          the same employment restrictions as F-1 and J-1 visa holders.

          study-related exchange programmes at US colleges and universities that
          have been authorised by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs
          of the US Department of State. Your programme must be sponsored by a

          You will require an I-20 certificate (or IAP66 in some cases) form to
          apply for an F-1 or M-1 visa and a DS-2019 form to apply for a J-1
          visa. Each form covers personal information, albeit they vary

          Some universities will give you an I-20 or DS-2019 together with your
          admissions letter, particularly if you have evidence that you have the
          resources to cover at least one year of academic study and are exempt
          from making a deposit. Other US colleges would not release an I-20 or
          DS-2019 until funding has been verified, any institutional financial
          awards have been made, and a deposit has been paid.

          <span style="font-weight: 700"> Level I</span> – Bachelor’s degree or
          Undergraduate: In the USA, a Bachelor’s degree course is regarded as
          an UnderGraduate (UG) course. Usually, the duration of the UG courses
          in the USA is four years. The first two years of study comprise a
          variety of classes in different subjects. The most common subjects
          that are being taught in the first two years of UG courses are
          history, arts, literature, science and social sciences. May
          international students in the US choose a community college to
          complete the first two years of UG prerequisite courses. These
          students obtain an AA (Associate of Arts) degree and then transfer to
          a four-year university or college. Apart from the above mandatory
          courses in the UG, a ‘major’ is the specific field of study in which
          your degree is focused. In order to meet the degree requirements of
          the major course, you must take a certain number of courses in the
          chosen field. The major has to be chosen by the beginning of your
          third year of the UG course. One of the unique characteristics of the
          American education system is that you can change the major course
          multiple times. In simple words, the American education system is very
          flexible.

          Graduate: International students from only a limited number of
          countries are allowed to pursue Master’s courses in the US. Usually,
          the duration of the Master’s courses in America is one year or two
          years. Most of the master’s courses are merely based on classroom
          teaching, and each student must prepare a long research paper called
          Master’s thesis or complete a Master’s project. For admission to a
          gradation program, applicants are required to sit exams such as GRE or
          GMAT, LSAT for law, and MCAT for medical programs. Students can even
          Study in USA Without IELTS.

          Usually, the duration of PhD in America is three years. However, for
          international students, a Doctorate degree may take up to five or six
          years to complete. Students can enter Doctoral degree courses with a
          Master’s degree. The majority of universities in the US enrol new
          students during the autumn. Therefore, international students can
          apply for admission during this season.

          When applying for college in the US states, make sure you meet the
          same academic requirements equivalent to the country’s one. In the US,
          there are laws that apply to the entire country (federal or general
          laws), and then there are state laws that vary based on where you live
          and study. Check the admission requirements for foreign students at
          the university to make sure you are eligible to apply because the US
          permits the states to set their own rules for colleges.
